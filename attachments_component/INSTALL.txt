INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - Attachments 2.2
===========================================

To install the Attachments extension just use the Joomla! installer on the zip
file from the Joomlacode website.  It will install the components and all the
plugins and enable them.  You should not need to do anything else.

If the normal Joomla! installer fails install the component or any of the
seven Attachments plugins, you may need to install them manually.  Here are
the steps:

   * Create a new folder

   * Unzip the Attachments 2.0 installation zip file into the folder

   * Install each plugin/component ZIP in the folder using the Joomla! installer:
       - admin/install/attachments_plugin_framework.zip
       - admin/install/attachments_for_content.zip
       - admin/install/attachments_plugin.zip
       - admin/install/add_attachment_btn_plugin.zip
       - admin/install/insert_attachments_token_btn_plugin.zip
       - admin/install/attachments_search.zip
       - admin/install/show_attachments_in_editor_plugin.zip
       - admin/install/attachments_component_manual_install.zip

   * Go to the plugin manager and enable the corresponding plugins:
       - Attachments - For Components Plugin Framework
       - Attachments - For Content
       - Content - Attachments
       - Editor Button - Add Attachment
       - Editor Button - Insert Attachments Token
