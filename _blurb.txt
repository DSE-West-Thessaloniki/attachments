There are options to control who can see the attachments and who can upload them, along with many other options to increase its flexibility and usefulness.

Releases 2.2+ and 3.0+ give you several ways to add, edit, and delete your attachments on the front end, back end, and in article editors on the front and back ends (including during article creation).  There are many options to control who can see attachments.  When you add or edit attachments, page updates are done quickly without full page reloads.

If you plan to use this extension for sensitive files, use the 'Secure' mode. This provides secure storage of attachment files and prevents access by anyone without logging in.
