   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Migrating Attachments's documentation!
=================================================

.. warning::

   I've been alerted that the conversion process sets the 'Access Level' for
   all migrated attachments to 'Public'.  This is not the correct behavior.  I
   will modify the Attachents later today to use the 'Default Access Level'
   option.  So if this is a concern to you, please wait until tomorrow (August
   14, 2011) before trying the migration process.  You will also need to
   reinstall Attachments.  I'll put the details here when this fix is ready.
